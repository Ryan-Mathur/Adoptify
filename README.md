## Overview

This application is designed to help you find pets near your location. 
Either enter in your zip code or have your location turned on and use the location button to get your current zip code!
This helps you get in touch with animals that don't have a voice or ones that you didn't even know where nearby!


## Technical Requirements
This app utilized googles location api,petfinder.com api, geocoding to translate location to address, recyclerviews, android networking, and location permissions.

## Research Approach

I took a general approach of asking users questions about pets. 

## Major Hurdles

A major hurdle that I had to overcome in this project was the fact that the first api was encoded using php and I couldn't figure out how to utilize it. The second api kept changing the way data was given to me it would sometimes be an object other times
a array of objects so it made the conversion from json to gson extremely challenging.

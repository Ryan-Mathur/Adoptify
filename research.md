Research Plan Worksheet One-Pager
Taken and adapted from Smashing Magazine
> Fill in each of the sections below to develop a research plan for your project.
1. Title - This should reflect what you’re researching, the methodology, or even the audience. For example, “Vacation app field study” or “General Assembly’s interviews with repeat students”
	Pet finder app to find pets via location. (prefer to look for shelter animals vs newborns)
	
2. Authors and stakeholders - Names, titles, and email addresses of those you’re working with and those you might be working for.
	Ryan Mathur
	
3. Date - The date! This gets updated whenever the plan gets updated.
	5/9/2017
	
4. Background - Provide a brief description of the events that led to this study and any relevant
recent history related to the idea or product development. Keep this to around a paragraph.
	The idea for the application came from my own desire to adopt a animal after my immersive program. I also was curious if there were any mobile apps that let you view animals available for adoption vs pet stores/shelters using social media.
	This then led me to think about if people would be more or less willing to adopt an animal dependent on distance. 
	
5. Goals - State the high-level reason (or reasons) for conducting this study - try to keep this to one sentence. If you can’t keep it to one sentence, try to create a short list of goals (no more than 4!)
	To help animals available for adoption find new homes or at least connect them to more people using technology
	
6. Research questions - This is where you get to the specifics of your plan. You’re aiming for 5-10 questions you’d like to have answered by the end of this research (not necessarily the questions you’ll be asking research participants). A great way to think of these is like they would be the headings in the study’s summary.
	How likely would people be to adopt animals and if they don't want to adopt would they recommend animals to friends if they knew they were looking for a animal to adopt.
	How far would someone be willing to travel to look at animals for adoption?
	What kinds of animals are available for adoption other than cats and dogs?
	Would users want to go visit the animal in person before they adopt or does that not matter to them?
	How specific would users want to have filters for ex. breed, size of dog breed, age, etc.
	
7. Methodology - This section is meant to briefly inform readers of what will happen, for how long and where.
	I will go around asking questions to people for their opinions about my app idea.
	
8. Participants - Who is your target audience? Write down some basic details about these people.
	I want to target people who do have pets
	I want to target people who don't have pets
	I would like a broad range of people from young adults to empty nesters maybe
	
9. Schedule - Three dates go here: when participant recruiting starts, when the study will take place, and when there will be results.
	When recruiting starts : TBD
	
10. Script - Write a list of five topics you want to learn about as your audience. Then, write one question that corresponds to each of those topics. Make sure you’re not leading or biasing the questions. (Remember, these questions are not the same as your research objectives.)
	Where do they go if they want to look for animals to adopt what resources do they use?
		How do you go about finding pets if you wanted a pet?
		
	How many pets would they ideally like to have if any?
		How many pets would you ideally like to have if any?
	
	Do people want to visit the animal before they adopt or no.	
		If you were interested in adopting a pet would you want to visit the pet first?
		
	How far are people willing to go if they found an animal they are interested in?
		How far would you travel for a prospect that interests you or does distance not matter.
		
	Does the specific type of breed or characteristics matter to people?
		When searching do you look for specific features or just look at animals in general?
	
	Other than breeds etc what would be the determining factors for someone to seriously consider adopting?
		What do you look for in the potential animal if you were interested (shots, spayed, neutered, etc)
		
		Would you rather adopt or look for a newborn animal?

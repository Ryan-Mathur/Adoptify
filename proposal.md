Overall Objectives, including problems to be solved and user goals to facilitate - these should be very specific and based on your research!
	To help connect people and animals needing a home together. The problem is right now that most people go to a local 
	pet store or online to a website to search for animals nearby.
	
Research Synthesis - what trends, goals, motivations, and pain points did you identify?
	Most people already own pets but would have any where from 2 to 4 pets
	People generally have to go to a website to search for animals not a lot of native apps especially good ones
	
Target Audience - must be very specific and represent your interviewees - What do they need and why? How/when/where do they use similar apps? What do they value and what do they avoid? Etc.
	Anyone from ages 23 to 40. They should have a stable home and have a job to support having a pet.
	This target group generally has integrated mobile phones into their everyday lives.
	They want to be able to search/filter results based on a ton of different variables (breed, age, sex, etc)
	They also want to be able to see if the animals is fixed, has shots etc.
	
Prioritized list of features - What problem or user goal does each one address? How did you determine priority?
	Users can search for animals nearby their current location or type in a location
	Results can be filtered and show how far the animal is to their current/searched location
	Users can favorite animals (firebase?)
	Share on social media
	Animals include cats and dogs
	
	
	Bonus:
	Custom notifications based on selections user has setup
	notification when a favorite animal has been adopted
	maybe a see others like this based on criteria
	multiple api sources
	add other animal types than cats and dogs
	
Differentiators from competitors and pain points addressed
	biggest difference if api allows is that I could set a notification if the animal has been adopted
	
Constraints you face - e.g. availability of data, need for permissions users may deny, unfamiliar technologies required, etc.
	not sure how often the api gets updated if at all
	users may deny location permission but a workaround is to let them also enter in location
	
Anything else you think we should know as we decide whether to approve your proposal
